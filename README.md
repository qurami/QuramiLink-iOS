## Description

QuramiLink is a convenient class that you can use to open an office page of Qurami directly from your app.  
It checks the availability of Qurami Client on the destination device and, if present, opens the office page.   
All you need to do is to provide a valid office link.   
We will update this class to ensure that any integration with the Qurami iOS client will be seamlessly supported.

## Usage üìñ

The usage is trivial, simply import `QuramiLink.h` in your implementation file and call:

```
[QuramiLink openQuramiOfficeWithOfficeLink: @"yourOfficeLink"];
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**IMPORTANT**‚ö†Ô∏è    
If you're currently using **Xcode 7** along with the **iOS 9** sdk, you have to add Qurami to your **whitelisted** apps by adding the key: `quramiapp`   
to the: `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` array in your `Info.plist`file.
